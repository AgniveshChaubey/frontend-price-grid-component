## My process

### Built with

- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
- HTML
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

By taking part in this challange, I recaped the custom CSS class implementations and recaped the use of bootstrap CSS classes.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

<!-- ```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
``` -->
